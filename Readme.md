# FuseRAG — Retrieval-Augmented Generation API Platform

---

## Overview

**FuseRAG** is a lightweight backend API that turns any document into a searchable, context-aware knowledge source for large language models (LLMs). With just a simple API key and your documents, you can seamlessly upload and query your data without worrying about complex setup, machine learning operations, or vector management.

FuseRAG leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to offer scalable document search and intelligent answers from your data — making it easy for developers to integrate sophisticated AI into their applications.
